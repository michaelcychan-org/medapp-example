## Hi,

The project is built using 

- [x] Uses cucumber swift for writing tests
- [x] To add new tests we must update the .feature files
- [x] The tests auto run on every deploy to the main branch
- [x] Uses AWS Cognite via Amplify for login
- [x] Uses email+password to login
- [x] Has a simple view with weight login
- [x] The weight loggin view has a check mechanism that ensures only integer entries are logged as weights
